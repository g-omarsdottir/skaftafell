                <div>
                    <p>Skaftafell Nature Reserve was founded as a national park in 1967 as one of the first national
                        parks in Iceland. Since 2008, it is part of <span lang="is">Vatnajökull</span> National Park,
                        one of three national parks in Iceland. Prior to 1974 there were no bridges across the vast
                        glacier rivers and therefore the area was one of the most isolated ones in the whole country.
                    </p>
                    <p>The reserve is quite sheltered from wind, resulting in a lush and tall vegetation. There are
                        numerous species of flora to be found in the reserve. One of the tallest species of spruce in
                        Iceland is found in Skaftafell.</p>
                    <p>Two active volcanoes are in the vicinity of the reserve. One of which erupts regularly every 5-10
                        years. The other one is more explosive and last erupted in 1727.</p>
                    <p>Skaftafell is easily accessible along Route 1. The closest population centres are
                        Kirkjubæjarklaustur 70 kilometres to the west and Höfn, 130 kilometres to the east. </p>
                    <p>There is a spacious campsite in Skaftafell with spots for motor homes, campers, and tents as well
                        as a variety of services available year-round.</p>
                    <p>It is truely a hiker's paradise, offering a range of hiking possibilities for experienced hikers
                        as well as those who simply wish to take it easy and experience the amazing natural environment.
                        The following trails are well marked, and you can easily follow the signs to each destination.
                        Maps are available at the Skaftafell Visitor Centre and <a

                            and leads to the viewpoint <span lang="is">Sjónarsker</span> above the Svartifoss waterfall.
                            Svartifoss is beautifully framed by unusually symmetric, thick basalt columns.

                            The trail then continues down into the ravine, across the footbridge, and climbs up the
                            basalt column steps on the other side of the ravine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trail offers a good view of the waterfall and the old turf house at Sel.
